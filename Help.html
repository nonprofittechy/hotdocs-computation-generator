  <p>The HotDocs Computation Generator simplifies the repetitive work of scripting a large number of components with HotDocs Developer, version 11 or newer. An earlier version 
  was developed in <a href="http://nonprofittechy.com/2017/05/03/using-powershell-to-manage-large-hotdocs-interviews/">PowerShell</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Select a Hotdocs 11+ component file that is stored on Google Drive, or upload a new component file to get started.
  </p>
  <p>
  The tools here will help you: 
  <ol>
    <li>Load a list of components from a dialog into a spreadsheet for you to manipulate.</li>
    <li>Add text (like SHOW or HIDE) keywords before/after selected components.</li>
    <li>Create a series of IF/THEN statements to conditionally set the value of a component based on an earlier selection.</li>
    <li>Create summary paragraphs based on true/false components.</li>
    <li>Generate REPEAT arrays from a sheet (as of 2017, mostly useful for interviews hosted on <a href="https://lawhelpinteractive.org/">LawHelpInteractive</a>).
    <!-- <li>Run some repetitive and easy to forget cleanup tasks on a component file, such as unlinking all components to dialogs.</li> -->
  </ol>
  <p>This add-on is non-destructive. The functions will generate text that you can copy into the HotDocs script editor
  but won't change the component file itself.
  The functions will load the most recent information from the component file in Google Drive each time that they run. For your convenience, when you
  select a component file, a new sheet will be created that lists all of the components in the file, which you can refresh when you like. 
  Changes made on this sheet do not change the component file.</p>
